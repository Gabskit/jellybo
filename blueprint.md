# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web application that will be enhanced with a mobile emulator for testing and visualization. The UI will be revamped to have a modern, "Flutter-like" design, and the application will be showcased in a new, Flutter-inspired mobile emulator.

## Current State

The project currently consists of a web page (`index.html`) and associated assets, and a basic mobile emulator.

## Plan: Flutter-Inspired Emulator and UI/UX Revamp

I will create a new, visually appealing mobile emulator with a design inspired by Flutter. I will also revamp the application's UI to be more modern and interactive.

### Steps:

1.  **Create a Flutter-Inspired Emulator:** I will create a new `www/flutter_emulator.html` file with a more modern and aesthetically pleasing design. This emulator will feature a sleek frame, drop shadows for depth, and a vibrant color scheme.
2.  **Embed the Application:** The existing `index.html` will be embedded within the new emulator using an `<iframe>`.
3.  **Modernize the Look and Feel:** I will update the application's CSS to include a new color palette, expressive typography, and a subtle background texture to give it a premium feel.
4.  **Add Interactive Components:** I will add interactive card components with drop shadows to create a sense of depth and make the UI more engaging.
5.  **Improve Layout:** I will create a more visually balanced and organized layout for the main content area of the application.

## Implemented Features

*   **Basic Mobile Emulator:** Created `www/emulator.html` to display the application in a simulated mobile device screen.
